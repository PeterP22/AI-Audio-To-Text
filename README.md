# AI Speech to Text Using OpenAI Whisper

This project utilizes OpenAI's Whisper model to transcribe spoken words into text. It captures audio from your microphone for a set duration, processes it through the Whisper model, and outputs the transcribed text.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or later
- Pip (Python package manager)

Step 1. Install dependencies
```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/openai/whisper.git

Step 3. After the duration has passed and you have communicated correctly, check the terminal for the output string based on what you verbally said.
